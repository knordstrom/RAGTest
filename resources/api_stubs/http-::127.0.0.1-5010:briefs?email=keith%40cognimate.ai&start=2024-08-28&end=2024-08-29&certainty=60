So I thought it worth reminding that I own the domain <http://sophis.ai|sophis.ai>.\n\nI bought it a few months ago when I had a job, thinking we might come to a point where we weren't entirely pleased with our working title :D\nprakash@cognimate.ai: Thanks for the update. Cognimate isn’t a slam dunk, but I think it is appropriate. Good that we have backups :sweat_smile: \nprakash@cognimate.ai: Branding  however might not be a major issue until we get past the seed stages. I think we spent over a million to rebrand as <http://data.ai|data.ai> from AppAnnie but ultimately it didn’t help \nemmasmithcto6306@gmail.com: <http://data.ai|data.ai> &gt;&gt; appannie in my opinion. Though it also doesn't relate terribly well to what the company did.\n\nBut I don't have any attachment here to changing anything, just providing it because we talked about it.\njohnbrowncpo8808@gmail.com: The issue is - having two different things to talk about - Cognimate suggesting stuff related to cognitive understanding and a “mate” and then Sofia as the actual thing needing real recognition by users. I like sophis which doesn’t mean anything real - and Sofia, as the assistant’s identity. Btw in the deck <@U06E2R1AYCU> you didn’t mention Cognimate. \nprakash@cognimate.ai: That’s one reason why I didn’t mention Congnimate except in the title slide. The product is Sofia. I am not married to Cognimate as the name \njohnbrowncpo8808@gmail.com: I think we shouldn’t go with cognimate. It’s too specific for my taste. I know we picked it together, but the word cognitive has been overused - thanks IBM! \nprakash@cognimate.ai: I considered Cognimate as a place holder - it seemed to describe well what our unique focus was in the world of AI personal assistants. Perhaps it is too literal and \"specific\" as you say. Some people think it is appropriate, while others like my wife just don't care for it. <http://Sophis.ai|Sophis.ai> might have fewer cons - who knows?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, branding is not something I am concerned about at the pre-funding stage.\n<@U06DKQZ2J4F> - Are we looking to incorporate and therefore the name has some finality to it?  (Product names can change quite easily)",

                "summary": "Here is a summary of the conversation:\n\nThe conversation is about branding and naming for a company and its AI assistant. Emma mentions that she owns the domain sophis.ai, which could be a backup option. The group discusses the pros and cons of using Cognimate as the company name, with some members feeling it's too specific and literal. Prakash, who seems to be the decision-maker, is open to changing the name and doesn't consider branding a major issue at this stage. The group also touches on the idea that the company name and product name can be different, and that they may need to incorporate and finalize a name soon.",
